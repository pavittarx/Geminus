## Warnings 
The project is no longer maintained by the original author, and the master branch was deleted by the author, so I got its total control since I made a little contribution to the original project and its forked branch existed with me.
I have no intention of developing the selfbot any further, so the project is archived as of now, but it can be downloaded, forked & used under default licensing terms. 
Thanks.
