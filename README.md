## Warnings 
The project is no longer maintained by the original author, and the master branch was deleted, so I got the ownership to the master branch of the project since I made a little contribution to the original project and its forked branch existed with me.
I have no intention of developing the Discord selfbot any further, so the project is archived as of now, but it can be downloaded, forked & used under default licensing terms. <br/>

## Disclaimer 
For the original author of the project, if you feel to have back the ownership of your project, please contact me and I will provide you with it.
